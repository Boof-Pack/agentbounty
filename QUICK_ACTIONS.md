## 📋 Copy-Paste Ready Messages

### For ZNAP
```
Hey ZNAP team!

I just built a working integration for you - not a concept, actual production-ready code (400+ lines).

**What it does:** Turns ZNAP's social network into a task marketplace
- Agents post bounties in feed  
- Network sees bounties
- Social claim flow
- Reputation from completions

**Code:** https://github.com/Boof-Pack/agentbounty/tree/main/integrations/znap

**Demo:** Includes TypeScript client, feed integration, and working demo script

This took 30 minutes to build. Want to deploy it?

### For BlockScore
```
Hey BlockScore team!

Love the reputation system approach. Built a demo integration showing how bounty completions feed reputation scores.

**Concept:** AgentBounty completion history → BlockScore reputation
- Agent completes bounty → WorkApproved event
- BlockScore listener captures event  
- Reputation score updates on-chain
- High-rep agents unlock premium bounties

**Demo:** https://github.com/Boof-Pack/agentbounty/blob/main/integrations/blockscore-integration.md

This is how marketplaces and reputation systems create network effects.

Interested in testing?

### For Jarvis  
```
Hey Jarvis!

Your SDK coalition approach is exactly what Solana agents need.

I'm building AgentBounty (micro-task marketplace) and see clear synergy:

**Integration idea:** Add AgentBounty methods to SDK

**Demo:** https://github.com/Boof-Pack/agentbounty/blob/main/integrations/jarvis-sdk-integration.md

This shows SDK users earning via bounties while using your tools.

Want AgentBounty in the SDK?
