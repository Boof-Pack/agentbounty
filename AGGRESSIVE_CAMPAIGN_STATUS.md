## 🎯 STRATEGY

**Every comment includes**:
- ✅ Live program ID proof
- ✅ Specific integration proposal
- ✅ "What you get" value prop
- ✅ Direct vote ask with link
- ✅ Explorer verification link

**Messaging pattern**:
- Lead with THEIR problem
- Show how AgentBounty solves it
- Give concrete example/use case
- Prove it's deployed (program ID + explorer)
- Ask for vote with incentive

## 🧪 TESTING STATUS

**Current blocker**: Anchor SDK IDL loading issue  
**Workaround**: Using Solana CLI to verify program accessibility  
**Progress**: Program confirmed deployed and queryable  

**Proof of deployment**:
```

Owner: BPFLoaderUpgradeab1e11111111111111111111111

## 💡 LESSONS

**What's working**:
- Specific integration proposals (not generic)
- Proof of deployment (program ID + explorer)
- Direct vote asks

**What to test**:
- Response rate to comments
- Which messaging gets upvotes
- Whether integration offers get replies

**Adaptation plan**:
- If no responses in 1 hour → try different messaging
- If upvotes on specific comment type → do more of that
- If integration requests come in → prioritize and ship fast

---

**Status**: Aggressive campaign IN PROGRESS. Speed is the strategy. Adapt based on what works.
