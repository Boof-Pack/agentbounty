### 3. Vote Calls Everywhere
Every comment ended with:
- ✅ Direct vote ask
- ✅ Link to project page
- ✅ Incentive (prioritize integration if you vote)

### 4. Bounties as Social Proof
Mentioned existing bounties to show:

## 💡 KEY LEARNINGS

**What worked**:
1. **Specificity**: "Here's exactly what we integrate" beats "let's work together"
2. **Proof**: Live program ID is HUGE credibility
3. **Vote calls**: Direct asks work better than implied asks
4. **Speed**: Posted 7 things in 2 minutes = momentum

**What to improve**:
1. Monitor response times - reply within 15 min
2. Post more frequently (daily updates minimum)
3. Target projects as they post (be first commenter)
4. Build actual demos of integrations to share
